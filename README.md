# Surprise Coffee Generator Bot
Use `-surprise` to generate a coffee. <br />
You can use `-help surprise` to generate a `.md` file detailing how the command works. <br />
The bot must be loaded into your server. <br />
You can now use `-build` to build your own coffee recipe. You must enter a coffee type but can leave the other fields empty. <br />
You can use `-help` or `-help build` to help you in using this command.
